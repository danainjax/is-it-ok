# Requirements [ 3/12 ]

[ ] The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible

[X] Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.

[X] Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app (Links to an external site.)

[X] Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application

[ ] There should be 2 container components

[ ] There should be 5 stateless components- the idea here is to use redux for your state, 5 components connected to your redux store for your state

[ ] There should be 3 routes

[ ] The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs (Links to an external site.); docs for v4 can be found here (Links to an external site.)) see restular.com

[ ] Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change

[ ] Make use of async actions and redux-thunk middleware to send data to and receive data from a server

[ ] Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.

[ ] Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation

[ ] Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
